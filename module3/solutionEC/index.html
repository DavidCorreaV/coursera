      <p id="text" class="text-justify">Hark! whence that rushing sound?
        'Tis like a wondrous strain that sweeps
        Around a lonely ruin 50
        When west winds sigh and evening waves respond
        In whispers from the shore:
        'Tis wilder than the unmeasured notes
        Which from the unseen lyres of dells and groves
        The genii of the breezes sweep. 55
        Floating on waves of music and of light,
        The chariot of the Daemon of the World
        Descends in silent power:
        Its shape reposed within: slight as some cloud
        That catches but the palest tinge of day 60
        When evening yields to night,
        Bright as that fibrous woof when stars indue
        Its transitory robe.
        Four shapeless shadows bright and beautiful
        Draw that strange car of glory, reins of light 65
        Check their unearthly speed; they stop and fold
        Their wings of braided air:
        The Daemon leaning from the ethereal car
        Gazed on the slumbering maid.
        Human eye hath ne'er beheld 70
        A shape so wild, so bright, so beautiful,
        As that which o'er the maiden's charmed sleep
        Waving a starry wand,
        Hung like a mist of light.
        Such sounds as breathed around like odorous winds 75
        Of wakening spring arose,
        Filling the chamber and the moonlight sky.
        Maiden, the world's supremest spirit
        Beneath the shadow of her wings
        Folds all thy memory doth inherit 80
        From ruin of divinest things,
        Feelings that lure thee to betray,
        And light of thoughts that pass away.
        For thou hast earned a mighty boon,
        The truths which wisest poets see 85
        Dimly, thy mind may make its own,
        Rewarding its own majesty,
        Entranced in some diviner mood
        Of self-oblivious solitude.

        Custom, and Faith, and Power thou spurnest; 90
        From hate and awe thy heart is free;
        Ardent and pure as day thou burnest,
        For dark and cold mortality
        A living light, to cheer it long,
        The watch-fires of the world among. 95

        Therefore from nature's inner shrine,
        Where gods and fiends in worship bend,
        Majestic spirit, be it thine
        The flame to seize, the veil to rend,
        Where the vast snake Eternity 100
        In charmed sleep doth ever lie.

        All that inspires thy voice of love,
        Or speaks in thy unclosing eyes,
        Or through thy frame doth burn or move,
        Or think or feel, awake, arise! 105
        Spirit, leave for mine and me
        Earth's unsubstantial mimicry!
        It ceased, and from the mute and moveless frame
        A radiant spirit arose,
        All beautiful in naked purity. 110
        Robed in its human hues it did ascend,
        Disparting as it went the silver clouds,
        It moved towards the car, and took its seat
        Beside the Daemon shape.

        Obedient to the sweep of aery song, 115
        The mighty ministers
        Unfurled their prismy wings.
        The magic car moved on;
        The night was fair, innumerable stars
        Studded heaven's dark blue vault; 120
        The eastern wave grew pale
        With the first smile of morn.
        The magic car moved on.
        From the swift sweep of wings
        The atmosphere in flaming sparkles flew; 125
        And where the burning wheels
        Eddied above the mountain's loftiest peak
        Was traced a line of lightning.
        Now far above a rock the utmost verge
        Of the wide earth it flew, 130
        The rival of the Andes, whose dark brow
        Frowned o'er the silver sea.
        Far, far below the chariot's stormy path,
        Calm as a slumbering babe,
        Tremendous ocean lay. 135
        Its broad and silent mirror gave to view
        The pale and waning stars,
        The chariot's fiery track,
        And the grey light of morn
        Tingeing those fleecy clouds 140
        That cradled in their folds the infant dawn.
        The chariot seemed to fly
        Through the abyss of an immense concave,
        Radiant with million constellations, tinged
        With shades of infinite colour, 145
        And semicircled with a belt
        Flashing incessant meteors.

        As they approached their goal,
        The winged shadows seemed to gather speed.
        The sea no longer was distinguished; earth 150
        Appeared a vast and shadowy sphere, suspended
        In the black concave of heaven
        With the sun's cloudless orb,
        Whose rays of rapid light
        Parted around the chariot's swifter course, 155
        And fell like ocean's feathery spray
        Dashed from the boiling surge
        Before a vessel's prow.

        The magic car moved on.
        Earth's distant orb appeared 160
        The smallest light that twinkles in the heavens,
        Whilst round the chariot's way
        Innumerable systems widely rolled,
        And countless spheres diffused
        An ever varying glory. 165
        It was a sight of wonder! Some were horned,
        And like the moon's argentine crescent hung
        In the dark dome of heaven; some did shed
        A clear mild beam like Hesperus, while the sea
        Yet glows with fading sunlight; others dashed 170
        Athwart the night with trains of bickering fire,
        Like sphered worlds to death and ruin driven;
        Some shone like stars, and as the chariot passed
        Bedimmed all other light.

        Spirit of Nature! here 175
        In this interminable wilderness
        Of worlds, at whose involved immensity
        Even soaring fancy staggers,
        Here is thy fitting temple.
        Yet not the lightest leaf 180
        That quivers to the passing breeze
        Is less instinct with thee,--
        Yet not the meanest worm.
        That lurks in graves and fattens on the dead,
        Less shares thy eternal breath. 185
        Spirit of Nature! thou
        Imperishable as this glorious scene,
        Here is thy fitting temple.

        If solitude hath ever led thy steps
        To the shore of the immeasurable sea, 190
        And thou hast lingered there
        Until the sun's broad orb
        Seemed resting on the fiery line of ocean,
        Thou must have marked the braided webs of gold
        That without motion hang 195
        Over the sinking sphere:
        Thou must have marked the billowy mountain clouds,
        Edged with intolerable radiancy,
        Towering like rocks of jet
        Above the burning deep: 200
        And yet there is a moment
        When the sun's highest point
        Peers like a star o'er ocean's western edge,
        When those far clouds of feathery purple gleam
        Like fairy lands girt by some heavenly sea: 205
        Then has thy rapt imagination soared
        Where in the midst of all existing things
        The temple of the mightiest Daemon stands.

        Yet not the golden islands
        That gleam amid yon flood of purple light, 210
        Nor the feathery curtains
        That canopy the sun's resplendent couch,
        Nor the burnished ocean waves
        Paving that gorgeous dome,
        So fair, so wonderful a sight 215
        As the eternal temple could afford.
        The elements of all that human thought
        Can frame of lovely or sublime, did join
        To rear the fabric of the fane, nor aught
        Of earth may image forth its majesty. 220
        Yet likest evening's vault that faery hall,
        As heaven low resting on the wave it spread
        Its floors of flashing light,
        Its vast and azure dome;
        And on the verge of that obscure abyss 225
        Where crystal battlements o'erhang the gulf
        Of the dark world, ten thousand spheres diffuse
        Their lustre through its adamantine gates.

        The magic car no longer moved;
        The Daemon and the Spirit 230
        Entered the eternal gates.
        Those clouds of aery gold
        That slept in glittering billows
        Beneath the azure canopy,
        With the ethereal footsteps trembled not; 235
        While slight and odorous mists
        Floated to strains of thrilling melody
        Through the vast columns and the pearly shrines.

        The Daemon and the Spirit
        Approached the overhanging battlement, 240
        Below lay stretched the boundless universe!
        There, far as the remotest line
        That limits swift imagination's flight.
        Unending orbs mingled in mazy motion,
        Immutably fulfilling 245
        Eternal Nature's law.
        Above, below, around,
        The circling systems formed
        A wilderness of harmony.
        Each with undeviating aim 250
        In eloquent silence through the depths of space
        Pursued its wondrous way.--</p>

        Floating on waves of music and of light,
        The chariot of the Daemon of the World
        Descends in silent power:
        Its shape reposed within: slight as some cloud
        That catches but the palest tinge of day 60
        When evening yields to night,
        Bright as that fibrous woof when stars indue
        Its transitory robe.
        Four shapeless shadows bright and beautiful
        Draw that strange car of glory, reins of light 65
        Check their unearthly speed; they stop and fold
        Their wings of braided air:
        The Daemon leaning from the ethereal car
        Gazed on the slumbering maid.
        Human eye hath ne'er beheld 70
        A shape so wild, so bright, so beautiful,
        As that which o'er the maiden's charmed sleep
        Waving a starry wand,
        Hung like a mist of light.
        Such sounds as breathed around like odorous winds 75
        Of wakening spring arose,
        Filling the chamber and the moonlight sky.
        Maiden, the world's supremest spirit
        Beneath the shadow of her wings
        Folds all thy memory doth inherit 80
        From ruin of divinest things,
        Feelings that lure thee to betray,
        And light of thoughts that pass away.
        For thou hast earned a mighty boon,
        The truths which wisest poets see 85
        Dimly, thy mind may make its own,
        Rewarding its own majesty,
        Entranced in some diviner mood
        Of self-oblivious solitude.

        Custom, and Faith, and Power thou spurnest; 90
        From hate and awe thy heart is free;
        Ardent and pure as day thou burnest,
        For dark and cold mortality
        A living light, to cheer it long,
        The watch-fires of the world among. 95

        Therefore from nature's inner shrine,
        Where gods and fiends in worship bend,
        Majestic spirit, be it thine
        The flame to seize, the veil to rend,
        Where the vast snake Eternity 100
        In charmed sleep doth ever lie.

        All that inspires thy voice of love,
        Or speaks in thy unclosing eyes,
        Or through thy frame doth burn or move,
        Or think or feel, awake, arise! 105
        Spirit, leave for mine and me
        Earth's unsubstantial mimicry!
        It ceased, and from the mute and moveless frame
        A radiant spirit arose,
        All beautiful in naked purity. 110
        Robed in its human hues it did ascend,
        Disparting as it went the silver clouds,
        It moved towards the car, and took its seat
        Beside the Daemon shape.

        Obedient to the sweep of aery song, 115
        The mighty ministers
        Unfurled their prismy wings.
        The magic car moved on;
        The night was fair, innumerable stars
        Studded heaven's dark blue vault; 120
        The eastern wave grew pale
        With the first smile of morn.
        The magic car moved on.
        From the swift sweep of wings
        The atmosphere in flaming sparkles flew; 125
        And where the burning wheels
        Eddied above the mountain's loftiest peak
        Was traced a line of lightning.
        Now far above a rock the utmost verge
        Of the wide earth it flew, 130
        The rival of the Andes, whose dark brow
        Frowned o'er the silver sea.
        Far, far below the chariot's stormy path,
        Calm as a slumbering babe,
        Tremendous ocean lay. 135
        Its broad and silent mirror gave to view
        The pale and waning stars,
        The chariot's fiery track,
        And the grey light of morn
        Tingeing those fleecy clouds 140
        That cradled in their folds the infant dawn.
        The chariot seemed to fly
        Through the abyss of an immense concave,
        Radiant with million constellations, tinged
        With shades of infinite colour, 145
        And semicircled with a belt
        Flashing incessant meteors.

        As they approached their goal,
        The winged shadows seemed to gather speed.
        The sea no longer was distinguished; earth 150
        Appeared a vast and shadowy sphere, suspended
        In the black concave of heaven
        With the sun's cloudless orb,
        Whose rays of rapid light
        Parted around the chariot's swifter course, 155
        And fell like ocean's feathery spray
        Dashed from the boiling surge
        Before a vessel's prow.

        The magic car moved on.
        Earth's distant orb appeared 160
        The smallest light that twinkles in the heavens,
        Whilst round the chariot's way
        Innumerable systems widely rolled,
        And countless spheres diffused
        An ever varying glory. 165
        It was a sight of wonder! Some were horned,
        And like the moon's argentine crescent hung
        In the dark dome of heaven; some did shed
        A clear mild beam like Hesperus, while the sea
        Yet glows with fading sunlight; others dashed 170
        Athwart the night with trains of bickering fire,
        Like sphered worlds to death and ruin driven;
        Some shone like stars, and as the chariot passed
        Bedimmed all other light.

        Spirit of Nature! here 175
        In this interminable wilderness
        Of worlds, at whose involved immensity
        Even soaring fancy staggers,
        Here is thy fitting temple.
        Yet not the lightest leaf 180
        That quivers to the passing breeze
        Is less instinct with thee,--
        Yet not the meanest worm.
        That lurks in graves and fattens on the dead,
        Less shares thy eternal breath. 185
        Spirit of Nature! thou
        Imperishable as this glorious scene,
        Here is thy fitting temple.

        If solitude hath ever led thy steps
        To the shore of the immeasurable sea, 190
        And thou hast lingered there
        Until the sun's broad orb
        Seemed resting on the fiery line of ocean,
        Thou must have marked the braided webs of gold
        That without motion hang 195
        Over the sinking sphere:
        Thou must have marked the billowy mountain clouds,
        Edged with intolerable radiancy,
        Towering like rocks of jet
        Above the burning deep: 200
        And yet there is a moment
        When the sun's highest point
        Peers like a star o'er ocean's western edge,
        When those far clouds of feathery purple gleam
        Like fairy lands girt by some heavenly sea: 205
        Then has thy rapt imagination soared
        Where in the midst of all existing things
        The temple of the mightiest Daemon stands.

        Yet not the golden islands
        That gleam amid yon flood of purple light, 210
        Nor the feathery curtains
        That canopy the sun's resplendent couch,
        Nor the burnished ocean waves
        Paving that gorgeous dome,
        So fair, so wonderful a sight 215
        As the eternal temple could afford.
        The elements of all that human thought
        Can frame of lovely or sublime, did join
        To rear the fabric of the fane, nor aught
        Of earth may image forth its majesty. 220
        Yet likest evening's vault that faery hall,
        As heaven low resting on the wave it spread
        Its floors of flashing light,
        Its vast and azure dome;
        And on the verge of that obscure abyss 225
        Where crystal battlements o'erhang the gulf
        Of the dark world, ten thousand spheres diffuse
        Their lustre through its adamantine gates.

        The magic car no longer moved;
        The Daemon and the Spirit 230
        Entered the eternal gates.
        Those clouds of aery gold
        That slept in glittering billows
        Beneath the azure canopy,
        With the ethereal footsteps trembled not; 235
        While slight and odorous mists
        Floated to strains of thrilling melody
        Through the vast columns and the pearly shrines.

        The Daemon and the Spirit
        Approached the overhanging battlement, 240
        Below lay stretched the boundless universe!
        There, far as the remotest line
        That limits swift imagination's flight.
        Unending orbs mingled in mazy motion,
        Immutably fulfilling 245
        Eternal Nature's law.
        Above, below, around,
        The circling systems formed
        A wilderness of harmony.
        Each with undeviating aim 250
        In eloquent silence through the depths of space
        Pursued its wondrous way.--</p>
